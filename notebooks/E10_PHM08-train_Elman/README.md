## List of Sublfiles

+ [01-warm_up](01-warm_up): I have tried Elman network with 1 hidden layer, tanh activation fuction in all neuros, with both binarized and -1/+ label enconder.

+ [02-warm_up](02-warm_up): SRN with tanh activation fuction on hidden layer and linear function in output layer with true labels of the health states.

+ [03-warm_up](03-warm_up): I might have made a mistake on both experiments, pay attention: the power of SRN relays on short-term memory, and be segregating the dataset by operationa condition I have trown away this kind of information. I will try to use the dataset without Operational conditions.

> It did not work. I did not used binarized labels. After two epochs the error archieves NaN.

+ [04-warm_up](04-warm_up): The same as experiment 03, but using binarized enconding for labels.
